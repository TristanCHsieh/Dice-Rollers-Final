- A character has to be created to get to the game/dice view 
- There is now a drop down field with all the dice options but the d4 is pre-filled in
- The dice image view can be tapped to roll the dice
- The results show up on the core graphic dice as well as in the game text
- Higher dices make your attack higher and lower dice e.g. d4 is more likely to heal you
- The dice core graphic and the dice image view still have pan gestures. If you send them towards the top of the screen they are hard to access unless you reset them by going to the previous view. Not sure if this counts as a bug but the directions said there could be some known bugs.
